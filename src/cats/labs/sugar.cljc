(defmacro ap
  "Apply a pure function to applicative arguments, e.g.

   (ap + (just 1) (just 2) (just 3))
   ;; => #<Just [6]>
   (ap str [\"hi\" \"lo\"] [\"bye\" \"woah\" \"hey\"])
   ;; => [\"hibye\" \"hiwoah\" \"hihey\"
          \"lobye\" \"lowoah\" \"lohey\"]

   `ap` is essentially sugar for `(apply fapply (pure f) args)`,
   but for the common case where you have a pure, uncurried,
   possibly variadic function.

   `ap` actually desugars in `alet` form:

   (macroexpand-1 `(ap + (just 1) (just2)))
   ;; => (alet [a1 (just 1) a2 (just 2)] (+ a1 a2))

   That way, variadic functions Just Work, without needing to specify
   an arity separately.

   If you're familiar with Haskell, this is closest to writing
   \"in Applicative style\": you can straightforwardly convert
   pure function application to effectful application by with
   some light syntax (<$> and <*> in case of Haskell, and `ap` here).

   See the original Applicative paper for more inspiration:

;; Monadic arrow macros.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(defmacro ->=
  "Like `->`, but with monadic binding instead of pure application.
   A mnemonic for the name is a pun on `>>=`, the monadic bind operator,
   and clojure's regular arrow macros.

   You can think of it as generalizing the `some->` thread macro
   to all Monads instead of just Maybe.

   Alternatively, if you think of the regular thread macro as
   sugar for `let`:

   (-> :a b (c (other args)) d)
   =>
   (let [res (b :a)
         res (c res (other args))
         res (d res)]
     res)

   Then `->=` is sugar for cats.core/mlet:

   (->= m-a b (c (other args)) d)
   (mlet [res m-a
          res (c res (other args))
          res (d res)]
     (return res))

   Note that extra args in this context are assumed pure, and will
   be evaluated along with the function itself; this also matches
   the behavior of `some->` wrt extra args.

   Threading through pure functions is somewhat awkward, but can be done:

   (->= m-a
        monadic-fn
        (-> pure-fn
            other-pure-fn
            m/return)
        other-monadic-fn)"

           (m/return ~g))))
