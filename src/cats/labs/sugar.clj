(defmacro ap
  "Apply a pure function to applicative arguments, e.g.

   (ap + (just 1) (just 2) (just 3))
   ;; => #<Just [6]>
   (ap str [\"hi\" \"lo\"] [\"bye\" \"woah\" \"hey\"])
   ;; => [\"hibye\" \"hiwoah\" \"hihey\"
          \"lobye\" \"lowoah\" \"lohey\"]

   `ap` is essentially sugar for `(apply fapply (pure f) args)`,
   but for the common case where you have a pure, uncurried,
   possibly variadic function.

   `ap` actually desugars in `alet` form:

   (macroexpand-1 `(ap + (just 1) (just2)))
   ;; => (alet [a1 (just 1) a2 (just 2)] (+ a1 a2))

   That way, variadic functions Just Work, without needing to specify
   an arity separately.

   If you're familiar with Haskell, this is closest to writing
   \"in Applicative style\": you can straightforwardly convert
   pure function application to effectful application by with
   some light syntax (<$> and <*> in case of Haskell, and `ap` here).

   See the original Applicative paper for more inspiration:
   http://staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf"
